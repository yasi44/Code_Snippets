## Crawlers

This repository contains some sample web scrappers that I developed as requirements of some projects.

In one of the NLP projects we needed to develop customized web scrappers to:
  - Collect comments of people on a portal related to construction projects. This portal had some complex inner loop (reply to reply) structure. 
  - Collect the relationship between those people that reply to commets of other writters. 
  - 

This file is a peice of that work.
