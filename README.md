This repository contains sample code snippests that I developed as requirements of some projects.


## Web Scrapper
Crawler_tabular.py
In one of the NLP projects we needed to develop customized web scrappers to:
  - Collect comments of people on a portal related to construction projects. This portal had some complex inner loop (reply to reply) structure. 
  - Collect the relationship between those people that reply to commets of other writters. 
  - 

This file is a peice of that work.


## Data processing acceleration using AWS EMR cluster 
PySpark_Crypto.py is a part of a crypto currency data analysis project. 
Here I used PySpark to accelerate the analysis of 1TB Bitcoin coin data(BTCUSD) stored in AWS S3, using AWS EMR cluster.
