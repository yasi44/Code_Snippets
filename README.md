# Crawlers

This repository contains some sample web scrappers that I developed as requirements of some projects.

### crawler_tabular.py
In one of the NLP projects we needed to collect all the comments of people on a portal related to construction projects. This portal had some complex inner loop (reply to reply) structure. I needed to develop a customized web scrapper to even collect the relationship between those people that reply to commets of other writters. 
this file is a peice of that work.
